# Lab 04_Streaming Data Processing with Spark

## Description
This lab is an assignment from the syllabus of <code>CSC14118</code> - Introduction to Big Data course, offered by Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Information Technology, University of Science - VNUHCM. The course is designed to provide students with an overview of the actively growing field of Big Data, including the principles of Big Data, the benefits and challenges of large-scale data analytics in modern life, and the vast number of Big Data tools applied in business intelligence and scientific research. Large-scale data has unique characteristics that require scaling up analytical technologies and algorithms, leading to new perspectives in data understanding and analysis. The course mainly guides students on handling data processes in batch mode and streaming mode using Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. Furthermore, the students will collaborate and share more Big Data topics, helping everyone attain a broad view of Big Data in practice.

## Objectives
This lab assignment aims to familiarize students with the concept of streaming data processing using Apache Spark. In this assignment, students will connect to an online source, specifically the Twitter API, simulate a streaming operation, and then use Spark Streaming to continuously retrieve and process the data.
